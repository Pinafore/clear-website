		<h3>Interdisciplinary Certificate Program in Human Language Technology</h3><br>
		<p>The University of Colorado now offers an Interdisciplinary Certificate 
			in Human Language Technology designed to provide a rich and broad background 
			for students interested in computational tools for human language processing. 
			This educational program is offered through the joint efforts of the <a href="index.php">Center 
			for Computational Language and Education Research</a>, the <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu" target="#">Department 
			of Computer Science</a>, the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/ling" target="#">Department 
			of Linguistics</a>, the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/slhs" target="#">Department 
			of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences</a>, and the <a href="http://ece-www.colorado.edu" target="#">Department 
			of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. </p><br>
		  <p>The Human Language Technology Program offers a Masters-level certificate, 
			which accompanies a normal M.A. or M.S. degrees in one of the four Human 
			Language Technology disciplines: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Computer Science </li>
			<li>Electrical and Computer Engineering</li>
			<li>Linguistics </li>
			<li>Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p></p>
		  <p>Human language technology is an interdisciplinary field that includes 
			key technological and scientific areas like : </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Computer Speech Recognition and Understanding </li>
			<li>Speech Modeling, Analysis and Processing for Recognition</li>
			<li>Natural Language Understanding and Generation </li>
			<li>Text and Audio-based Information Retrieval </li>
			<li>Web-based Dialog Agents </li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>The Certificate in Human Language Technology is designed to promote an 
			interdisciplinary experience for students seeking graduate studies in 
			the fields of speech processing and language technology. As such, HLT 
			Certificates are awarded to students who fullfill the 5 course requirements 
			summarized at the HLT web site. </p><br>

		  <p>The HLT Certificate program was established by CSLR an approved by the 
			University of Colorado Boulder to help promote an interdisciplinary experience 
			for students seeking advanced degrees in Linguistics, Electrical Engineering, 
			Computer Science, and Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences. Here, we 
			summarize the students who have fullfilled the requirements and have earned 
			the HLT Certificate. Each student receives their graduate degree from 
			their home department, and the HLT Certificate is coordinated between 
			the four participating departments and CSLR.</p><br>
