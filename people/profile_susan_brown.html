				<br><b>RESEARCH INTERESTS:</b>
				Computational linguistics and natural language processing, in particular semantic issues such as word sense disambiguation, semantic representations, and ontology development.  I am also interested in the use of psycholinguistic and corpus linguistic methodologies and insights to improve resources for statistical machine learning.
