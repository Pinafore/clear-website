				<br><b>RESEARCH INTERESTS:</b> My main research interests are in applied machine learning and natural language processing. In particular, I'm interested in intelligently applying machine learning methods to the topic of computational semantics, and in extension, software tools that help natural language researchers use machine learning effectively. My current research focuses on detecting markers of educational quality (as opposed to scientific quality) in web resources directed at teachers and students, as well as how to make this information accessible to users of such resources.
