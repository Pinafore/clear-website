			The Center for Computational Language and EducAtion Research (CLEAR)
			is dedicated to advancing Human Language Technology and applying it to
			Personalized Learning for broad and diverse populations with varying
			language backgrounds and cognitive profiles. Personalized Learning
			augments or replaces traditional modes of learning with emerging, and
			often interactive, technologies that adapt to suit individual
			preferences.  Personalized learning is such an important problem that
			it has recently been named by the National Academy of Engineering as
			one of the 14 grand challenges for the 21st century.
			&nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			CLEAR conducts research and development which informs theoretical
			questions in personalized learning and leads to effective and scalable
			solutions in schools, on the web and in the work place. Advancing
			personalized learning involves a multi-disciplinary effort that
			leverages innovations in human language technology that span computer
			science, linguistics, education, cognition, psychology, and speech and
			language.
			&nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Center projects include:  Adaptive assessment and intervention for
			reading difficulties, The development of increasingly rich linguistic
			annotation schemes that can serve as training and evaluation data for
			machine learning, Information extraction and natural language
			understanding using semantic role labeling and co-reference
			resolution, Spoken language processing and dialog understanding,
			and Human-computer interaction using animated agents or
			customizable interfaces. These projects have led to a wide variety of
			systems including some for language acquisition skills, tutoring and 
			therapy, tools for question answering and navigating the web, and for
			learning and presentation of science topics ranging from plate
			tectonics to acoustics.
